This programme has been vibecoded with AI because time is precious.

If you want to add more days to your workout plan, then:
  Create more .txt files (e.g "day 6.txt"), and the compiler will detect the additional days and compile them in the final compiled text file

If you want to remove a day or more from your workout plan, then:
  Remove any content from the desired day file. You do not need to delete the day text file, but that can work as well. The compiler will only ignore the file if there are no strings in the text file. In technical terms, the complete absence of unicodes
